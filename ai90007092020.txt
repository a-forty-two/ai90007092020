
i did not say he stole my laptop

- denying making statement
- somebody else 
- could 've written 
- she stole 
- borrowed
- your laptop
- shoes 


TRaining - Testing
	-> Training > Testing
	-> Testing cannot be NEW information
	-> ALL CASES should be handled in training 
	-> Don't go out of syllabus 


PaaS-> Compute and Storage are DIFF
	-> BILLED separately as per use
	-> Machine lEarning is COMPUTE (STORAGE account separate
	as local storage) 
	-> scalability rises/falls as users and demand!

IaaS-> infra and network level contrl
	-> TOO MUCH of management
	-> wastage -> pay for store/compute that you don't use!
	-> Scalability takes time-> VMs take time!

CPU or GPU-> which one is faster?
	
100 potatoes
Team1-> 1 person who can eat 5 potatoes/min
Team2-> 1 person who can eat 1 potato/min but 20 such people!
who will finish faster?
T2-> GPU (GBs)-> throughput size is large, slow speed
	-> comp vision, NLP, audio, neurals, deep learning
T1-> CPU (MHz, GHz)-> instructions are RISC/CISC, fast speed
	=> statisitical data, tabular data, machine learn with graphs


FPGA-> field programmable gate array
	(Deployment unit) -> programmable gates


Classification-> preselected algos to run on my data
	-> some algos could be VERY Expensive
	

185 people-> all of you like chola bhature 
	-> 50-> fav food?-> 35 chole bhature
	-> 50-> fav food?-> 26
	-> 50-> fav food?-> 25 XXX -> samosa-> CROSS VALIDATION
	PROVED OVERFITTING!!!!
	-> 50-> fav food?-> 26 





	-> Lab access emails -> please check junk folders 
	also later (post 3pm- will take time to generate)
	-> some of you may start receiving earlier 

Clean Data:
	- drop the data if small % (my tolerance 5%)
	- fix it
		- replace by mean (statistical data, outside dataset)
		-median (central tendencies, inside dataset)
		-mode (most common values) 
		-custom value

ML is an EXPERIMENT:
	-> MULTIPLE RUNS
	-> EACH run is an ML execution
	-> RUN 1 with Linear reg of HP1 
	-> RUN 2 with Linear reg of HP2
	-> RUNx with NN reg of HPx

Resuming 4:20 IST
